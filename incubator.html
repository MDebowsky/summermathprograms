      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">What is it?</h1>

    <p> The purpose of the Summer Program Incubator is to provide mentorship and assistance to individuals and organizations who want to start new summer programs aligned with the Consortium's <a href="index.html#mission" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mission and vision</a>. 
    The Incubator is free to participants and offers the following benefits:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>One-on-one mentorship by one of the Consortium's <a href="https://summermathprograms.org/membership.html#current-members" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">member or affiliate programs</a>, with detailed guidance on <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OazDOsHsuDbts0Jl0NP4iVFlWuH5uPzxzte90r9Uybs/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">all aspects of setting up a summer math program</a> (administrative, logistical, pedagogical, philosophical). Your mentor will support you every step of the way for the next 18 months. 
        </li>
        <li>The opportunity to visit one or more Consortium member programs in Summer 2026 and to attend the Consortium's <a href = "https://summermathprograms.org/conference.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">annual conference</a> in Fall 2026 and Fall 2027 (with all travel and conference expenses covered by the Incubator).</li>
        <li> Seed grants of up to $13,000 to help fund the first summer of your program, as well as introductions to other potential funders in this space. </li>
        <li> Access to Consortium resources and community, including our internal document repository and Consortium seminars. Many opportunities to network, ask questions, and get advice. </li>
        <li>Membership in a cohort of similar programs, to share ideas and experiences.</li>

    </ul>

<p> Each cohort of participants will join the Incubator for two years, with applications due in January 2026 for programs that plan to launch in Summer 2027.</p>

  <div class="w3-twothird w3-container">
      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Who is it for?</h1>

    <p> The eligibility requirements for the Incubator are similar to the criteria for <a href="membership.html#membership-criteria" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Consortium membership</a>, but somewhat more flexible. If your proposed program fits most but not all of the following criteria, please <a href="mailto:incubator-questions@summermathprograms.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">email us</a> to discuss. <p>  </p>
    <ul>
    <li> The Incubator is intended to help start in-person, not-for-profit summer programs (residential or non-residential), at which participants do intensive mathematics with a focus on enrichment rather than remediation or acceleration.</li> 
    <li> The Incubator is primarily geared toward programs serving middle and high school students; however, programs for elementary school students will also be considered.</li>
    <li> The ideal Incubator applicant will have already assembled a team of two or more people who are committed to seeing the project through to completion and who plan to be involved with it long-term. </li>
    <li> <i> Important: At least one team member must have a strong background in advanced mathematics and/or extensive experience with math enrichment programs. </i> The assistance provided by the Incubator is not primarily mathematical in nature: although we can offer some mentorship and support in this area, we rely on participants to bring their own mathematical vision to the project.</li>
    <li> Incubator participants must commit to making some effort at broadening participation in their programs and must plan to eventually offer financial assistance to students who need it.</li>
    <li> Non-US-based programs may be eligible if we can find a suitable Mentor for them. (Only a few Consortium members and affiliates have experience running programs in other countries.) Note, however, that funding for some Incubator activities may be available to US-based programs only.</li>
    </ul>

<p class="w3-text-red"> When considering applying for the Incubator, please keep in mind that starting a new summer math program is a very ambitious undertaking! We are looking for applicants who are serious about their plans and fully committed to doing what it takes to launch their programs in the summer of 2027.

  <p> Below is a timeline for the 2026–2027 Incubator cohort. For more detailed information, please see our <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wwnHtmjo78ZKA9FYhTX1evJw5Iri-ENQ/view?usp=drive_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Handbook for Incubator participants and Mentors.</a>
</p>


      <h4>January 2026</h4>
        <ul>
          <li> Applications due January 20, 2026.</li>
        </ul>

      <h4>February 2026</h4>
        <ul>
          <li> Incubator participants selected. Each participant is matched with a Consortium member or affiliate program that will act as their Mentor for the next two years.</li>
          <li> Participants receive access to all Consortium resources, including a set of introductory materials prepared especially for the Incubator.</li>

        </ul>

      <h4>Spring 2026</h4>
        <ul>
          <li> Incubator participants meet individually with their Mentors at least monthly. They also meet with the Consortium's Incubator Committee as a cohort at least once during the spring. Cohort meetings are an opportunity for participants to get to know one another, share information, and ask for advice. The frequency of these meetings can range from monthly to quarterly and will depend on participants’ needs and interests. 
</li>
          <li> In consultation with their Mentor, Incubator participants work on developing a clear vision for their program and a concrete  plan of action for the coming academic year. A <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bP4JUeT4hXfMiujo9JHTPbQdbWsXXGD2/view?usp=drive_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> detailed program plan</a> is due to the Incubator Committee at the end of May.</li>

        </ul>

     <h4>Summer 2026</h4>
        <ul>
          <li> Each program enrolled in the Incubator sends one or two team members to visit their Mentor's summer program and/or another Consortium program. Funding for these visits is provided by the Incubator.</li>
        </ul>
    
    <h4> Fall 2026</h4>
      <ul> 
        <li> Incubator participants attend the Consortium's <a href="conference.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">annual conference</a>, with funding for travel and housing provided by the Incubator.  </li>
        <li> Cohort meetings and regular check-ins with Mentors continue, as each participant begins to implement the plan that they developed the previous spring. </li>
      </ul>

    <h4> Winter and spring 2027</h4>
      <ul> 
        <li> Mentors and the Consortium's Incubator Committee continue to be available to assist with program preparation as needed.</li>
      </ul>  

    <h4> Summer 2027</h4>
      <ul>
        <li> <strong>Incubator participants launch their summer programs.</strong></li>
        <li> (Optional) Participants can request for someone from their Mentor program or another Consortium program to visit them during the summer, 
          in order to observe and give feedback.</li>
      </ul>

    <h4> Fall 2027</h4> 
      <ul> 
        <li> Participants attend the Consortium conference to debrief on their summer and to help support the next Incubator cohort. Funding is again provided by the Incubator.</li>
      </ul>
