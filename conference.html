<!-- 
<blockquote><i>The first phase of applications is complete; everybody who submitted their member interest form or application to participate by August 25th has been invited to register. <br /><br />We expect to have a full house, but we do still have a few places available, so you may still request a spot!

<p><b>What:</b> The program will be in the style of previous <a href="https://summerprogramsroundtable.org/" target="_blank">Summer Programs Roundtables</a>, with one notable update: the first 24 hours (Thursday night + Friday day) will be specifically for Consortium member programs, and we'll open up the activities from Friday night through Sunday afternoon to all conference participants. That gives us a chance to have committee meetings / working sessions on Friday, but still create cross-pollination of ideas with a wider range of community members.</p>

<p><b>Who:</b> Folks serving as representatives from their program to the Consortium have guaranteed participant spots. We plan to extend invitations to folks from other programs with shared interests (some of whom could become Consortium members down the line), as well as guest speakers to bring expertise on relevant topics. We will also open applications to the public. We expect 50 participants in total.</p>

<p><b>Funding:</b> We will provide funding to conference participants for travel, hotel rooms, and meals. The conference hotel is the <a href="https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/bosfn-residence-inn-boston-back-bay-fenway/overview/" target="_blank">Residence Inn in Back Bay / Fenway</a>; we will cover Thursday night rooms for member program representatives, and Friday and/or Saturday night rooms for all participants. Breakfast is included at the hotel; lunch and snack breaks will be catered at the BU Math Department; we'll provide a per diem for dinners. We'll cover up to $1000 per participant for travel expenses.</p>

<p><b>In-person vs online:</b> A lot of the benefit of gathering is the informal meal time chatting, so we hope those who are able will join us in person at Boston University. But we also want to make the event accessible: plenary talks will be hybrid, and we'll make some roundtable sessions open to remote participants as well via <a href="https://owllabs.com/products/meeting-owl-3" target="_blank">OWL</a>s.</p>

<p>The organizers gratefully acknowledge the generous support of <a href="https://www.polynera.org/" target="_blank">Polynera</a> for making the event possible!</p>

<p><b>COVID-19</b>: We are asking all on-site participants to test each morning (and we will provide tests). Masks are optional. Please notify a conference organizer in case of symptoms or a positive test. For more details, here are the <a href="2023ConsortiumConferenceCovid19Protocols.pdf">2023 Consortium Conference COVID-19 Protocols</a>.</p>

<p><b>Code of Conduct</b>: The Summer Mathematics Programs Consortium supports equality of opportunity and treatment for all participants, and seeks to foster an atmosphere that encourages the free expression and exchange of ideas, and simultaneously seeks to ensure a safe and welcoming environment free of harassment, bullying, retaliation, and discrimination of any kind for all attendees of the Annual Conference. We are asking all participants to actively uphold this commitment to one another. In the event that something goes wrong, we have reporting procedures and response plans in place to address issues in a timely and sensitive manner. Here is the <a href="2023ConsortiumConferenceCodeOfConduct.pdf">2023 Consortium Conference Code of Conduct</a>.</p>

<p><b>Recording Policy</b>: The Consortium will be making recordings for the purposes of advertising and promotion of the Consortium and/or the Annual Conference, and there will be an (opt-in) group photo. As an extension of the Code of Conduct, we expect participants to treat one another with respect: obtaining permission before making recordings, not using recordings for malicious purposes, and honoring any requests for removal. Here is the <a href="2023ConsortiumConferenceRecordingPolicy.pdf">2023 Consortium Conference Recording Policy</a>.</p>

<p>Here's our plan for getting you from here to the conference:</p>

<ul><li>Step one is the <b><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScrt0dZrDQsTWCpTCjA0iR3I1z3ESbAyjOvpEFlmS2nbujL_g/viewform" target="_blank">initial interest form</a></b>. Please fill out this interest form if you (individually) might be interested in participating! It gets you on our radar, gives us a sense of the shape of the event, and gets you to the next steps. One interest form per person, please; if multiple people from the same program would like to participate, they each fill out their own form. The final deadline for submitting this form is <b>September 18, 2023</b>.</li>

<li>After you submit this form, we'll invite you to fill out an <b>activities survey</b> to help us shape the sessions. (We'll also ask if you're interested in running a discussion or giving a talk.) We would appreciate responses to the activities survey by September 12; the final-final deadline will be September 18.</li>

<li>We'll also invite you to fill out a <b>registration form</b> about logistical details (hotels, travel, dietary restrictions, accessibility needs, etc) with a deadline of September 18th.</li>

<li>Confirmed participants should arrange their own travel arrangements and hotel reservations. For rooms booked in our hotel block at the Residence Inn in Back Bay / Fenway, the cost of the room and tax will be paid directly through conference funding; you still need to make your own reservation individually.

<li>Finally: there will also be a <b>reimbursement form</b> to get your plane tickets, dinners, etc covered. The form can be submitted before the event, upon arrival, and/or up to a month following the event. Note that you may submit the form multiple times.</li>
</ul>

<p>Look forward to seeing you in October, and in the meantime, we'll be in touch!</p>
