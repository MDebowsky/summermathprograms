<h2>2024 Conference Information</h2>

<p><b>When and Where:</b> September 19&ndash;22, 2024 at the <a href="https://www.gatechhotel.com/" target=_blank>Georgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center</a>.</p>


<p><b>What:</b> The annual Summer Mathematics Programs Consortium Conference is an opportunity for the leaders of intensive summer math programs to come together to further our collective work.

<br>
<br>

Here's how the workshop is structured: the first 24 hours (Thursday night + Friday day) is a day for Consortium members and affiliates to engage in working sessions. Then, we'll open up the activities from Friday night through Sunday afternoon to all conference participants, for a combination of working sessions and presentations for the rest of the weekend.</p>

 


<p><b>Who:</b> 
This is our big opportunity for Consortium members and affiliates to connect in person! 
We will also extend invitations to other folks with shared interests (some of whom could become Consortium members or affiliates down the line), as well as to guests who bring expertise on relevant topics, and we welcome applications from the public. 
We can accommodate up to 100 participants in total.</p>



<p><b>Funding:</b> Thanks to our generous supporters, we are happy to be able to provide funding to conference participants for travel, hotel rooms, and meals. Specifically: we will cover Thursday, Friday, and/or Saturday night rooms; breakfast, lunch, and snack breaks will be catered at the conference center; we'll either provide dinner as part of the conference schedule or provide a per diem for dinners; and we will cover travel expenses. See <!-- MARISA ADD LINK TO TRAVEL DOC HERE --> </p>

<ul>
  <li>Up to three conference participants per member organization are guaranteed funding. Member organizations can propose additional participants, and may apply for additional funding. Requests will be granted according to available space and funding.</li>
   <li>One conference participant per affiliate organization is guaranteed funding. Affiliate organizations with members who actively contribute to the consortium through committee work or other contributions, may have up to three participants receive funding. Affiliate organizations can propose additional participants, and may apply for additional funding. Requests will be granted according to available space and funding.</li>
    <li>Those who are able to share hotel rooms are encouraged to do so.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>In-person vs online:</b>  A key benefit of gathering together is the informal chatting between sessions and over meals, so we hope those who are able will join us in person at Georgia Tech. But we also want to make the event accessible: if you would prefer to participate virtually, please indicate this on the form below!</p>

<!--
<p><b>COVID-19</b>: We are asking all on-site participants to test each morning (and we will provide tests). Masks are optional. Please notify a conference organizer in case of symptoms or a positive test. For more details, here are the <a href="2023ConsortiumConferenceCovid19Protocols.pdf">2023 Consortium Conference COVID-19 Protocols</a>.</p>
-->

<p><b>Code of Conduct</b>: The Summer Mathematics Programs Consortium supports equality of opportunity and treatment for all participants, and seeks to foster an atmosphere that encourages the free expression and exchange of ideas, and simultaneously seeks to ensure a safe and welcoming environment free of harassment, bullying, retaliation, and discrimination of any kind for all attendees of the Annual Conference. We are asking all participants to actively uphold this commitment to one another. In the event that something goes wrong, we have reporting procedures and response plans in place to address issues in a timely and sensitive manner. We will soon post the <a href="2024ConsortiumConferenceCodeOfConduct.pdf">2024 Consortium Conference Code of Conduct</a>.</p>

<p><b>Recording Policy</b>: The Consortium will be making recordings for the purposes of advertising and promotion of the Consortium and/or the Annual Conference, and there will be an (opt-in) group photo. As an extension of the Code of Conduct, we expect participants to treat one another with respect: obtaining permission before making recordings, not using recordings for malicious purposes, and honoring any requests for removal. We will soon post the <a href="2024ConsortiumConferenceRecordingPolicy.pdf">2024 Consortium Conference Recording Policy</a>.</p>

<p>Here's our plan for getting you from here to the conference:</p>

<ul><li>Step one is the <b><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfuGSiKwiR8PZTp6mqR6DW4kDMzmW-tzYiZLUARagdFcodAvg/viewform" target="_blank">initial interest form</a></b>. 
Please submit one form per program; if multiple people from the same program would like to attend, you'll be able to indicate that on this form.
The final deadline for submitting this form is <b>May 31, 2024</b>.</li>

<!-- MARISA - MAY NEED TO EDIT THIS -->
<!--
<li>After you submit this form, we'll invite you to fill out an <b>activities survey</b> to help us shape the sessions. (We'll also ask if you're interested in running a discussion or giving a talk.) We would appreciate responses to the activities survey by September 12; the final-final deadline will be September 18.</li>
-->

<li>We'll also invite you to fill out a <b>registration form</b> about logistical details (hotels, travel, dietary restrictions, accessibility needs, etc) with a deadline of <b>August 1, 2024</b>.</li>

<li>Confirmed participants should arrange their own travel arrangements and hotel reservations. For rooms booked in our hotel block at the Georgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center, the cost of the room and tax will be paid directly through conference funding; you still need to make your own reservation individually.

<li>Finally: there is a <b>reimbursement form</b> to get your plane tickets, dinners, etc covered. The form can be submitted before the event, upon arrival, and/or up to a month following the event. Note that you may submit the form multiple times.</li>
</ul>


<p>Look forward to seeing you in September, and in the meantime, we'll be in touch!</p>
