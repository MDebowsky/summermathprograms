<h2>2025 Conference Information</h2>

<h4 class="w3-text-red">Save the date!</h4>

<!--<h4 class="w3-text-red"> The fall 2025 conference is underway! Here's the <a href="2025/ConsortiumConferenceProgram.pdf" target="_blank">detailed program</a>. </h4> -->

<!-- <h4 class="w3-text-blue-grey">Thank you so much to all our 2025 conference participants! See you next year.
</h4> -->


<p><b>When and Where:</b> Our annual conference will take place November 14&ndash;16, 2025 at the <a href="https://www.gatechhotel.com/" target=_blank>Georgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center</a>. We will also be running a pre-conference workshop November 13&ndash;14, by invitation only, for member and affiliate programs.</p>

<p><b>What:</b> The annual Summer Mathematics Programs Consortium Conference is an opportunity for the leaders of intensive summer math programs to come together to further our collective work. Here's how the weekend will be structured:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The pre-conference workshop will begin Thursday afternoon (approximately 3pm), and include sessions on Thursday afternoon and small-group social activities on Thursday evening. The workshop continues with sessions approximately 9am&ndash;5pm on Friday, and concludes with dinner on Friday.</li>
  <li>The conference begins with a social meet-and-greet on Friday night. Conference activities will continue with sessions all day Saturday, a social gathering on Saturday night, and sessions on Sunday morning, and will conclude with lunch on Sunday.</li>
  <li>Bonus session: we are designing a small-group activity for Members and Affiliates on Sunday afternoon (details TBD!), and the bonus session will run in the early afternoon on Sunday, concluding approximately 3pm.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Who:</b> This is our big opportunity for Consortium members and affiliates to connect in person, with one another and with fellow travelers in the STEM enrichment ecosystem!</p>
  <li>The pre-conference workshop is designed for a group of 40&ndash;50 invitees, and will be focused on sharing expertise and building connections between Member and Affiliate program leaders. Participation is by invitation only.</li>
  <li>The conference is designed for up to 125 participants in total. Folks serving as representatives from their programs to the Consortium have guaranteed conference participant spots. We will also extend invitations to other folks with shared interests (some of whom could become Consortium members or affiliates down the line), as well as to guests who bring expertise on relevant topics, and we welcome applications from the public.</li>
  <li>Invitation details for the bonus session on Sunday afternoon are still TBD.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Funding:</b> Thanks to our generous supporters, we are happy to be able to provide funding to conference participants for travel, hotel rooms, and meals. 
  Specifically: we willl cover Friday and/or Saturday night rooms; breakfast, lunch, and snack breaks will be catered at the conference center; we'll provide a per diem for dinners; and we will cover travel expenses. We will also cover Thursday night hotel rooms and Thursday/Friday meals for participants invited to join the Pre-Conference Workshop.</p>

      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Accessibility and Policies</h1>

<p><b>Accessibility</b>: We are committed to making the conference accessible to all participants; you can include necessary accommodation information when you complete a registration form. We will work with you on implementing plans.
</p>

<p><b>Code of Conduct</b>: The Summer Mathematics Programs Consortium supports equality of opportunity and treatment for all participants, and seeks to foster an atmosphere that encourages the free expression and exchange of ideas, and simultaneously seeks to ensure a safe and welcoming environment free of harassment, bullying, retaliation, and discrimination of any kind for all attendees of the Annual Conference. We are asking all participants to actively uphold this commitment to one another. In the event that something goes wrong, we have reporting procedures and response plans in place to address issues in a timely and sensitive manner. Here is the <a href="2024/ConsortiumConferenceCodeOfConduct.pdf" target="_blank">2024 Consortium Conference Code of Conduct</a>.</p>

<p><b>Recording Policy</b>: The Consortium will be making recordings for the purposes of advertising and promotion of the Consortium and/or the Annual Conference, and there will be an (opt-in) group photo. As an extension of the Code of Conduct, we expect participants to treat one another with respect: obtaining permission before making recordings, not using recordings for malicious purposes, and honoring any requests for removal. Here is the <a href="2024/ConsortiumConferenceRecordingPolicy.pdf" target="_blank">2024 Consortium Conference Recording Policy</a>.</p>
