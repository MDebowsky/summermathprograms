<h2>2025 Conference Information</h2>

<h4 class="w3-text-red">Save the date!</h4>

<!--<h4 class="w3-text-red"> The fall 2025 conference is underway! Here's the <a href="2025/ConsortiumConferenceProgram.pdf" target="_blank">detailed program</a>. </h4> -->

<!-- <h4 class="w3-text-blue-grey">Thank you so much to all our 2025 conference participants! See you next year.
</h4> -->


<p><b>When and Where:</b> Our annual conference will take place November 14&ndash;16, 2025 at the <a href="https://www.gatechhotel.com/" target=_blank>Georgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center</a>. We will also be running a pre-conference workshop November 13&ndash;14, by invitation only, for member and affiliate programs.</p>

<p><b>What:</b> The annual Summer Mathematics Programs Consortium Conference is an opportunity for the leaders of intensive summer math programs to come together to further our collective work. Here's how the weekend will be structured:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The pre-conference workshop will begin Thursday afternoon (approximately 3pm), and include sessions on Thursday afternoon and small-group social activities on Thursday evening. The workshop continues with sessions approximately 9am&ndash;5pm on Friday, and concludes with dinner on Friday.</li>
  <li>The conference begins with a social meet-and-greet on Friday night. Conference activities will continue with sessions all day Saturday, a social gathering on Saturday night, and sessions on Sunday morning, and will conclude with lunch on Sunday.</li>
  <li>Bonus session: we are designing a small-group activity for Members and Affiliates on Sunday afternoon (details TBD!), and the bonus session will run in the early afternoon on Sunday, concluding approximately 3pm.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Who:</b> This is our big opportunity for Consortium members and affiliates to connect in person, with one another and with fellow travelers in the STEM enrichment ecosystem!</p>
  <li>The pre-conference workshop is designed for a group of 40&ndash;50 invitees, and will be focused on sharing expertise and building connections between Member and Affiliate program leaders. Participation is by invitation only.</li>
  <li>The conference is designed for up to 125 participants in total. Folks serving as representatives from their programs to the Consortium have guaranteed conference participant spots. We will also extend invitations to other folks with shared interests (some of whom could become Consortium members or affiliates down the line), as well as to guests who bring expertise on relevant topics, and we welcome applications from the public.</li>
  <li>Invitation details for the bonus session on Sunday afternoon are still TBD.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Funding:</b> As in previous years, we hope to provide funding for participants to cover travel, hotel rooms, and meals for the pre-conference workshop as well as the conference. Stay tuned for details when registration opens!</p>

<!--  
<p>Thanks to our generous supporters, we are happy to be able to provide funding to conference participants for travel, hotel rooms, and meals. 
  Specifically: we will cover Thursday (for members/affiliates), Friday, and/or Saturday night rooms; breakfast, lunch, and snack breaks will be catered at the conference center; 
  we'll either provide dinner as part of the conference schedule or provide a per diem for dinners; and we will cover travel expenses. 
  Some details are as follows:</p>      
<ul>
  <li>Up to three conference participants per member organization are guaranteed funding. Member organizations can propose additional participants, and may apply for additional funding. Requests will be granted according to available space and funding.</li>
   <li>One conference participant per affiliate organization is guaranteed funding. Affiliate organizations with members who actively contribute to the consortium through committee work or other contributions, may have up to three participants receive funding. Affiliate organizations can propose additional participants, and may apply for additional funding. Requests will be granted according to available space and funding.</li>
    <li>Those who are able to share hotel rooms are encouraged to do so.</li>
</ul>

<p style="font-style: italic;">The policies below are from 2024 and have not yet been updated for 2025.</p>

<p><b>COVID-19 Policy</b>: We are asking all on-site participants to test each morning (and we will provide tests). Masks are optional. Please notify a conference organizer in case of symptoms or a positive test. For more details, here are the <a href="2024/ConsortiumConferenceCovid19Protocols.pdf" target="_blank">2024 Consortium Conference COVID-19 Protocols</a>.</p>

<p><b>Code of Conduct</b>: The Summer Mathematics Programs Consortium supports equality of opportunity and treatment for all participants, and seeks to foster an atmosphere that encourages the free expression and exchange of ideas, and simultaneously seeks to ensure a safe and welcoming environment free of harassment, bullying, retaliation, and discrimination of any kind for all attendees of the Annual Conference. We are asking all participants to actively uphold this commitment to one another. In the event that something goes wrong, we have reporting procedures and response plans in place to address issues in a timely and sensitive manner. Here is the <a href="2024/ConsortiumConferenceCodeOfConduct.pdf" target="_blank">2024 Consortium Conference Code of Conduct</a>.</p>

<p><b>Recording Policy</b>: The Consortium will be making recordings for the purposes of advertising and promotion of the Consortium and/or the Annual Conference, and there will be an (opt-in) group photo. As an extension of the Code of Conduct, we expect participants to treat one another with respect: obtaining permission before making recordings, not using recordings for malicious purposes, and honoring any requests for removal. Here is the <a href="2024/ConsortiumConferenceRecordingPolicy.pdf" target="_blank">2024 Consortium Conference Recording Policy</a>.</p>

<!--
<p>Here's our plan for getting you from here to the conference:</p>

<ul><li>Step one is the <b><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfuGSiKwiR8PZTp6mqR6DW4kDMzmW-tzYiZLUARagdFcodAvg/viewform" target="_blank">initial interest form</a></b>.  The deadline for submitting this form is <b>May 31, 2024</b>.
<ul>
  <li>One major change from last year:  Please <b>submit one form per program</b>; if multiple people from the same program would like to attend, you'll be able to indicate that on this form.</li>
</ul>
</li>
  
<li>We'll also invite you to fill out a <b>registration form</b> about logistical details (hotels, travel, dietary restrictions, accessibility needs, etc) with a deadline of <b>August 1, 2024</b>.</li>

<li>Confirmed participants should arrange their own travel arrangements and hotel reservations. For rooms booked in our hotel block at the Georgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center, the cost of the room and tax will be paid directly through conference funding; you still need to make your own reservation individually.

<li>Finally: there is a <b>reimbursement form</b> to get your plane tickets, dinners, etc covered. The form can be submitted before the event, upon arrival, and/or up to a month following the event. Note that you may submit the form multiple times.</li>
</ul>

<p>Look forward to seeing you in September, and in the meantime, we'll be in touch!</p>
