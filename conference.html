<h2>About the Conference</h2>


<p><b>When and Where:</b> Our annual conference will take place November 14&ndash;16, 2025 at the <a href="https://www.gatechhotel.com/" target=_blank>Georgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center</a>. We will also be running a pre-conference workshop November 13&ndash;14, by invitation only, for member and affiliate programs.</p>

<p><b>What:</b> The annual Summer Mathematics Programs Consortium Conference is an opportunity for the leaders of intensive summer math programs to come together to further our collective work. Here's how the weekend will be structured:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The pre-conference workshop will begin Thursday afternoon at 3pm, and include sessions on Thursday afternoon and small-group social activities on Thursday evening. The workshop continues with sessions 9am&ndash;5pm on Friday, and concludes with dinner on Friday.</li>
  <li>The conference begins with a social meet-and-greet on Friday night. Conference activities will continue with sessions all day Saturday, a social gathering on Saturday night, and sessions on Sunday morning, and will conclude with lunch on Sunday.</li>
  <li>Bonus session: we are designing a small-group activity for Members and Affiliates on Sunday afternoon (details TBD!), and the bonus session will run in the early afternoon on Sunday, concluding approximately 3pm.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Who:</b> This is our big opportunity for Consortium members and affiliates to connect in person, with one another and with fellow travelers in the STEM enrichment ecosystem!</p>
  <li>The pre-conference workshop is designed for a group of 40&ndash;50 invitees, and will be focused on sharing expertise and building connections between Member and Affiliate program leaders. Participation is by invitation only.</li>
  <li>The conference is designed for up to 125 participants in total. Folks serving as representatives from their programs to the Consortium have guaranteed conference participant spots. We will also extend invitations to other folks with shared interests (some of whom could become Consortium members or affiliates down the line), as well as to guests who bring expertise on relevant topics, and we welcome applications from the public.</li>
  <li>On Sunday afternon, we'll have a bonus session focused on the work of the Consortium's <a href="committees.html">committees</a>, which current and prospective Consortium members and affiliates are invited to join.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Funding:</b> Thanks to our generous supporters, we are happy to be able to provide funding to conference participants for travel, hotel rooms, and meals. 
  Specifically: we willl cover Friday and/or Saturday night rooms; breakfast, lunch, and snack breaks will be catered at the conference center; we'll provide a per diem for dinners; and we will cover travel expenses. We will also cover Thursday night hotel rooms and Thursday/Friday meals for participants invited to join the Pre-Conference Workshop.</p>
